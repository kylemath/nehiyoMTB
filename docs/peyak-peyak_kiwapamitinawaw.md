## The ICU Connection: A Bilingual Pun

The trail builder, an ICU (Intensive Care Unit) physician, chose a name rich with layered meaning. In English, "ICU" and "I see you" are homophonous—they sound identical—creating a pun that reflects the deep care and individual attention central to intensive care medicine.

### ICU in Plains Cree

While there isn't a standard Cree translation for "ICU" (a modern medical institution), the concept could be expressed through descriptive compounds:

- **sohkī-kanawēyimikamik** = "place of strong/intensive caring"
  - *sohkī* = strong, intense, hard
  - *kanawēyimêw* = to care for/look after someone
  - *‑kamik* = place suffix

- **sohkī-nākat ohihamākwān** = "place of intensive attention/monitoring"
  - *nākatawēyimêw* = to pay close attention to someone
  - *‑hamākwān* = building/place for specific purpose

### The Connection

The act of truly *seeing* each patient—**kiwâpamitin**—embodies the essence of intensive care: acknowledging and attending to each person as a complete, unique individual. Just as the ICU physician watches each patient closely and individually, the phrase captures both the literal act of seeing and the deeper act of recognition and acknowledgment.

In Cree culture, the verb *wâpamêw* (to see someone) carries connotations beyond mere visual perception—it implies recognition, acknowledgment, and presence. This aligns perfectly with the ICU physician's practice of truly *seeing* each patient in their full humanity.

## Building Other Forms

### "I see you (all)"
- **Formula**: ki‑ + wâpam + ‑itinâwâw → **kiwâpamitinâwâw**
- **Syllabics**: ᑭᐚᐸᒥᑎᓈᐚᐤ
- **Breaking it down**:
  - ki‑ = marks "you" (plural)
  - wâpam = "see"
  - ‑itinâwâw = "you (all, plural)"

### "I see you, each one individually"
- **Formula**: pêyak‑pêyak + kiwâpamitinâwâw → **pêyak‑pêyak kiwâpamitinâwâw**
- **Syllabics**: ᐯᔭᐠ‑ᐯᔭᐠ ᑭᐚᐸᒥᑎᓈᐚᐤ
- **What it adds**: 
  - pêyak‑pêyak = "one by one; each one" (distributive/reduplicative)
  - This makes explicit the individualized attention: not just "I see you all" but "I see each of you, one by one"

**Why pêyak‑pêyak?** The trail builder's English phrase "I see you" was understood to mean seeing each person individually, not merely as part of a group. The Cree translation makes this explicit by adding the distributive modifier.

### "I see them"
- **Formula**: ni‑ + wâpam + ‑âwak → **niwâpamâwak**
- **Syllabics**: ᓂᐚᐸᒫᐘᐠ
- **Breaking it down**:
  - ni‑ = marks "I" (first person)
  - wâpam = "see"
  - ‑âwak = "them" (third person plural)

### "He/She sees you"
- **Formula**: ki‑ + wâpam + ‑ik → **kiwâpamik**
- **Syllabics**: ᑭᐚᐸᒥᐠ
- **Breaking it down**:
  - ki‑ = marks "you" (being seen)
  - wâpam = "see"
  - ‑ik = "he/she sees you" (inverse marker)

### "I see you (repeatedly)"
- **Formula**: mîna‑mîna + kiwâpamitinâwâw → **mîna‑mîna kiwâpamitinâwâw**
- **Syllabics**: ᒦᓇ‑ᒦᓇ ᑭᐚᐸᒥᑎᓈᐚᐤ
- **What it adds**:
  - mîna‑mîna = "again and again; repeatedly"
  - Different from pêyak‑pêyak: emphasizes temporal repetition rather than individual distribution

## Trail Context

This phrase names a mountain bike trail in the Edmonton area. The trail builder, an ICU physician, wanted to express the idea of seeing and acknowledging each person as a whole individual. The Cree translation—particularly with **pêyak‑pêyak**—makes this individualized attention explicit, embodying both the linguistic precision of Plains Cree and the cultural value of recognizing each person's wholeness and individuality.

The bilingual pun (ICU ≈ I see you) adds a layer of meaning that connects the trail name to the builder's medical practice, where truly *seeing* each patient as an individual is central to care.
