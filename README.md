Nehiyawewin trail signs for Edmonton

Set of 3d printable trail signs made for mountain bike trails around Edmonton, Canada, using Cree syllabics and english. You can print the .stl files, tested on a Creality Ender 3. You can also edit the .skp files in google sketchup yourself. 

After printing in PLA, I spray praint with white primer, then use Acrylic paints for colour.
